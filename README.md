# Detecting structured repetition in child-surrounding speech: Evidence from maximally diverse languages 

This repository contains data and code for the processing and analysis of variation sets in child-surrounding speech and adult-directed speech from 8 maximally typologically distinct languages.  
  
The repo is split into four primary sections. 
  
**1. Data**   
The **Data** subdirectory contains the files modeling_data_random.Rdata` and `modeling_data.Rdata`. These objects carry all data necessary for the final set of analyses. 

**2. Processing**   
The **Processing** subdirectory contains all data preparation. The `processing_revised.Rmd` file covers all data preprocessing for the analyses. 

The **Text_simulation** subdirectory covers the generation (`randomize_texts.Rmd`) and processing (`random_text_processing.Rmd`) of the randomized versions of the texts. 

**3. Analysis**    
The **Analysis** subdirectory contains the all code for the statistical analyses. 

**4. Results**    
The **Results** subdirectory stores the plots and model summaries that are reported in the manuscript.
